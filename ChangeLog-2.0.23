  * Test before defining macro _GNU_SOURCE.
  
  * Better use of inline functions and resolved compiler warnings.
  
  * Prevent error messages to grow larger than the maximum size. (issue #82)
  
  * Change return value for siridb_shard_status() from void to int containing
    the number of characters written.
    
  * Updated ct_items() and ct_itemsn() callback function and added the length
    of the key. The key is no longer terminated so the length must be used.
    
  * Updated the node object for ctree with the key length so we can skip a
    few strlen() calls when doing a loopup.
