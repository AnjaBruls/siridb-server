  * Implemented time-precision for select statements. We can later extend the
    query language with support for querying with another time-precision.
  
  * When queue-full status is set, leave it set even when a new status update 
    is received.
    
  * Mark a server as unavailable when a time-out on a flags package is
    received. The unavailable status prevents sending select queries and
    insert new data to this server. This status flag is never applied in case
    this is the only server in a pool and will be removed when a new status
    update from the target server is received.
  
  * Cleanup optimize task in case a memory allocation error has occurred.
  
  * Fixed QPack length check for strings.
