  * Changed error message when trying to merge series into an empty destination
    name and updated test.
    
  * Change max open files when soft-limit cannot be set.
  
  * Added support for log (string) values.
  
  * Fixed bug with reading path variable.
  
  * Added stddev() aggregation function.
  
  * Added first() and last() aggregation functions.
  
  * Allow aggregation functions without a time range. When no time range is 
    given, all aggregations will return a single value. The time-stamp returned 
    with the value is the last within the selected time range except when using
    the first() aggregation, in that case the first time-stamp will be used.
    
  * Allow all (*) for selecting series. Keyword 'all' replaces 'points' which
    is now a deprecated keyword.

  * Solved compiler warnings. (issue #96)
  
  * Added the following server statistics properties:
    - active_tasks: returns the number of active tasks for the current database
    - idle_time: returns the seconds the database was idle since uptime.
    - idle_percentage: returns the percentage of idle time since uptime.  
    (Note: idle mean no active tasks for the current database)
